# Bike Buyers Dashboard Project

Welcome to my **Bike Buyers Dashboard Project**â€”an interactive Excel dashboard crafted from real data, transformed and visualized to extract meaningful insights. As my second foray into Excel project building, this one is a bit more straightforward than [my previous Excel project](https://github.com/adinramaadin/Excel_Project-1_data-job-market). However, my goal was to ensure I could revisit key concepts and continue refining my data skills.

Through this project, Iâ€™m focused on effective data cleaning, Power Query transformations, and dashboarding techniques. From handling data transformations to building an interactive dashboard, I focused on creating a tool thatâ€™s both informative and easy to use for exploring buying patterns among different groups. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of what I achieved:

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals and Workflow

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation in Power Query**
   
 **Starting in Power Query**, I went through essential data transformations to prepare the dataset for analysis. Here are the key steps I took:
   
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Ensured data accuracy by removing duplicate rows, eliminating inconsistencies.
   - **Standardize Column Values**:
     - **Marital Status**:  Translated "M" to "Married" and "S" to "Single" for clarity.
     - **Gender**: Transformed "M" to "Male" and "F" to "Female".
   - **Format Conversion**:
     - Converted **Income** values into currency format (Dollar) to facilitate financial analysis.
   - **Age Grouping**: Categorized age into meaningful groups for demographic insights. Hereâ€™s the custom formula I used:
     
     ```powerquery
     = Table.AddColumn(#"Format Conversion", "Age Brackets", each 
          if [Age] < 31 then "Adolescent" 
          else if [Age] >= 31 and [Age] <= 55 then "Middle Age" 
          else if [Age] > 55 then "Senior" 
          else null
     )
     ```

### 2. **Loading Data to Excel and Building Visualizations**

   After transforming the data, I loaded it back into Excel to build **Pivot Tables** and **Charts** for deeper analysis. This included:

   - **Average Income by Gender and Bike Purchase Status**:

   - **Bike Purchase Count by Distance from Store**:

   - **Bike Purchase Count by Age Bracket**:

### 3. **Dashboard Creation**

   To bring the insights to life, I designed an interactive **Dashboard** with slicers and connections for real-time filtering. The slicers allow users to filter by categories such as **Education, Marital Status, Number of Children a Person Has, Number of Cars Owned** and **Region**, enabling customized views for deeper insights.

## ðŸ“Š How to Use

1. **Open the [Bike_Buyers_Dashboard.xlsx](https://github.com/adinramaadin/Excel_Project-2_Bike_Sales/blob/main/Bike_Buyers_Dashboard.xlsx) File** and go to the **Dashboard** sheet.
2. **Explore Using Slicers** to view the data filtered by categories, offering an interactive way to explore the data.

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights Discovered

Through this analysis, I observed several interesting patterns:
- **Income Influence**: On average, customers who purchased a bike had a slightly higher income, with male customers in particular showing a significant difference between those who bought and those who didnâ€™t.
- **Commuting Distance**: Commuting distance influences bike purchases as shorter distances make biking more practical, affordable, and convenient.
- **Age Group Trends**: The "Middle Age" group had the highest purchase count, suggesting they are the primary target demographic, while younger "Adolescents" and older "Seniors" had comparatively fewer purchases.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Source

The dataset is originally from Alex The Analyst, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Excel-Tutorial/blob/main/Excel%20Project%20Dataset.xlsx), and also in this repository in the [Data](https://github.com/adinramaadin/Excel_Project-2_Bike_Sales/tree/main/Data) folder for quick reference.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Project Matters

I created this project as a practice piece to solidify my understanding of data transformation techniques and visualization skills in Excel. Working through this project allowed me to refresh my skills in Power Query, and I believe the resulting dashboard is a valuable tool for understanding customer segmentation and purchasing patterns.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Requirements

- **Software**: Microsoft Excel (with Power Query enabled).
- **Dataset**: Bike Buyers, structured for analysis in Power Query.

Thank you for checking out this project! I aimed to show how Excel can be used to perform impactful data analysis and create clear, interactive dashboards. Whether you're exploring Excel for similar use cases or evaluating my work, I hope this project demonstrates a practical approach to analyzing data effectively.
